# Patterns Behind Purchases: End-to-End Analysis For Global E-Commerce 

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes sales transaction data using SQL and Tableau to identify key revenue drivers, seasonal demand patterns, and market-level differences across countries and product categories. By examining overall sales performance, unit economics, and country-specific purchasing behavior, particularly in high-population markets such as the United States, China, and India; the analysis uncovers where revenue is concentrated and how customer demand varies over time. The results are visualized through interactive Tableau dashboards, enabling stakeholders to quickly assess performance, evaluate risk, and make data-driven decisions related to pricing, inventory planning, and market strategy.
